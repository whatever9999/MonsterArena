# MonsterArena
A C++ game made for my intro to programming unit at university.
Involves an AI mouse solving randomly generated mazes to get to the cheeeeeeeese.
From what I remember I totally messed up a committing at one point (forgot to on laptop then did on PC and couldn't from laptop and so on) so MonsterArenaFinal shows the final product made using a backup :)
