# MonsterArena
A C++ game made for my intro to programming unit at university.
A turn-based game with attacking, healing, defending and such against an AI opponent.
From what I remember I totally messed up a committing at one point (forgot to on laptop then did on PC and couldn't from laptop and so on) so MonsterArenaFinal shows the final product made using a backup :)
